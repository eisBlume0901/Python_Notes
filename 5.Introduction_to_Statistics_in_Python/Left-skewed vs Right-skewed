Left-skewed / Negatively-skewed
- mean is less than median, and the median is less than the mode
- median is often a better measure of central tendency
- mode > median > mean
- Examples:
    Age at retirement (most people retire around the same age, but some retire much earlier
    Scores on a very easy exam (most students score high, but a few score very low)
Right-skewed / Positively-skewed
- mean is greater than the median, and the median is greater than the mode
- mean is often a better measure of central tendency
- mean > median > mode
- Examples:
    Income (most people earn at a moderate amount, but a few earn exceptionally high incomes)
    Time to complete a task (most people finish quickly, but a few take much longer)

Notes:
1. Central Tendency: Always use the MEDIAN as the measure of central tendency rather than the mean in skewed distributions,
as it is less affected by extreme values
2. Spread: Interquartile Range (IQR) is a better measure of spread than the standard deviation in skewed distributions since
it is not influenced by outliers.
3. Impact of Skewness: Some tests assume normality (no skewness), so alternative non-parametric tests might be appropriate
4. Data Transformation: Consider transforming the data to reduce skewness (e.g., log transformation, square root transformation)
if a normal distribution is required for analysis
5. Always visualize the data using HISTOGRAMS, box plots, or Q-Q plots to get a sense of the distribution and the presence
of skewness
