Independent events
- two events are independent if the probability of the second event IS NOT affected
by the outcome of the first event
- example: flipping a coin and got an outcome as a head first, then flipping a coin and got another outcome as tail for second attempt
    Regardless of the attempts, whether we get a head or tail, every time a coin is flip a head will get 50% chance which is also the same with tail

Dependent events
- two events are dependent if the probability of the second event IS AFFECTED
by the outcome of the first event
- example: choosing a card from a deck and then choosing another without putting the first card back in the deck

Sample with replacement (an example for independent event)
Examples:
1. Rolling a die twice
2. Flipping a coin 3 times

Sample without replacement (an example for a dependent event)
Examples:
1. Randomly picking 3 people to work on weekend from a group of 20 people
2. From a deck of cards, dealing 3 players 7 cards each
3. Randomly selecting 5 products from the assembly line to test for quality assurance
