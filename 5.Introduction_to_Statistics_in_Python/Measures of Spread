Measures of spread / variability / dispersion - how tightly clustered or spread out data values are
- The higher the result, the more spread out the data with respect to mean
- Measure of spread is highly dependent on the distribution of data and the specific goals of analysis

Sensitive to outliers - suitable to normal distributions
1. Variance / mean-squared error
2. Standard Deviation / L2 norm / Euclidean Distance
3. Range

Robust to outliers - suitable for skewed distributions
1. Mean Absolute Deviation / L1 norm / Manhattan Distance / Rectilinear Distance
2. Median Absolute Deviation
    a. Median = 50th Quantile = 50th Percentile
Order Statistics- important in identifying outliers (especially for large volumes of data),
its extent of impact in the distribution, and identify any skewness or asymmetry. Also, it is useful
for providing valuable summary of the entire distribution.
3. Quantile - dividing dataset into equal portions (quartiles = 4 parts, quintiles = 5 parts)
4. Decile - divides the data into ten equal parts
5. Percentile - divides the data into hundred equal parts
6. Interquartile Range (IQR) - difference between 25th and 75th percentile

Why squared deviations and positive values matter with respect to the mean:

- Squaring deviations ensures all are positive, preventing cancellation of positive and negative deviations,
which can skew results.
- Emphasizes larger deviations, crucial for understanding spread:
  - Simplifies calculations.
  - Provides smoother functions for analysis.
- Maintains consistency with the concept of variability:
  - Variability represents differences from the mean, inherently positive or zero.
- Example: Heights - deviation from average height, which is always positive, helps in consistent comparison
across datasets.

How to get quantiles?
{65, 72, 78, 80, 85, 87, 90, 92, 95, 98}

Here's how we can calculate quartiles for this dataset:

1. Sort the Data:
   - Sorted dataset: {65, 72, 78, 80, 85, 87, 90, 92, 95, 98}

2. Identify the Positions of Quartiles:
   - Q1 (25th percentile): (25/100) × (10 - 1) = 2.25 (Interpolate between the 2nd and 3rd values)
   - Q2 (50th percentile, also the median): (50/100) × (10 - 1) = 4.5 (Interpolate between the 4th and 5th values)
   - Q3 (75th percentile): (75/100) × (10 - 1) = 6.75 (Interpolate between the 6th and 7th values)

3. Extract the Quartiles:
   - Q1: Interpolated between the 2nd and 3rd values: Q1 = 72 + 0.25 × (78 - 72) = 73
   - Q2 (median): Interpolated between the 4th and 5th values: Q2 = 80 + 0.5 × (85 - 80) = 82.5
   - Q3: Interpolated between the 6th and 7th values: Q3 = 87 + 0.75 × (90 - 87) = 88.75

So, the quartiles for this dataset are Q1 = 73, Q2 = 82.5 (median), and Q3 = 88.75.

These quartiles help us understand the distribution of exam scores and identify key points within the dataset,
such as the range of scores for the middle 50% of students.
