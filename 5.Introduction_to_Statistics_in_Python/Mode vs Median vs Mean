Mode
- can be non-unique or not exist at all
- for continuous data, the mode can be less meaningful because the exact same value might not be repeated often
- useful: categorical data where we want to know the most common category (e.g., most popular product)
Mean
- provides a unique central tendency that takes into account every data point in the dataset
- especially useful for data that are symmetrically distributed and without outliers
- useful: quantitative analysis such as calculating averages, in financial metrics, and in most statistical analyses
that assume normally distributed data
Median
- always unique and represents the middle value of a dataset making it a robust measure of central tendency
- especially useful for skewed distributions and datasets with outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values
- useful: economics, real estate where data often have skewed distributions (e.g., income, property prices - since not a
lot of people have high income)
