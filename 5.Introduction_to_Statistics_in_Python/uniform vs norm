Uniform Distribution
Shape: Flat where each outcome in a specified range is equally likely
Characteristics:
- continuous or discrete
- all outcomes in the range have the same probability
- defined by a minimum and maximum values
Applications:
- rolling a die, random generation within a range

Normal Distribution
Shape: Bell-shaped curve that is symmetric around the mean
Characteristics
- the mean, median, and mode of the distribution are equal
- the total area under the curve equals 1
- defined by two parameters: mean and standard deviation
- empirical rule: 68% of data within 1 standard deviation, 95% within 2 standard
deviations, 99.7% within 3 standard deviations
Applications
- modelling continuous data that clusters around a central value
- IQ scores, heights, measurement errors
