Vocabulary:

Experiment aims to answer: What is the effect of the treatment on the response?

- Treatment = explanatory / independent (x) variable
- Response = response / dependent (y) variable

Controlled Experiments
- Participants are assigned by researchers to either treatment or control group
- Example:
- A/B Testing
    Treatment group sees advertisement
    Control group does not
        Groups should be comparable so that causation can be inferred. If groups are not comparable, this could
        lead to confounding (bias)
            Treatment group average age: 25
            Control group average age: 50
            Age is a potential confounder
               - This experiment would lead bias saying that the advertisement only works for younger aged group


The gold standard of experiments will use either
1. Randomized controlled trial
    Participants are assigned to treatment/control randomly, not based on any other characteristic (like the age confounder example)
    Choosing randomly helps ensure that groups are comparable
2. Placebo
    Resembles treatment, but has no effect
    Participant will not know which group they are in (to eliminate bias and let the participants act on what the researcher wants to gain from them)
        Example: In clinical trials, a sugar pill ensures that the effect of the drug is actually due to the drug itself and not the idea of receiving the drug
3. Double-blind trial
    Person administering the treatment/running the study does not know whether the treatment is real or a placebo
    Prevents bias in the response and/or analysis of results

Fewer opportunities for bias = more reliable conclusion about causation

Observational Studies
- Participants are not assigned randomly to groups
    Participants assign themselves, usually based on pre-existing characteristics
- Many research questions are not conducive to a controlled experiments
    Example: You cannot force someone to smoke or have a disease
    You cannot make someone have certain past behavior
- Establish association, not causation
    Effects can be confounded by factors that got certain people into the control or treatmnet group
    The are ways to control for confounders to get more reliable conclusions about association

Longitudinal - followed over a period of time to examine the effect of treatment on response
Cross-sectional - collected from a single snapshot of time (effect of age on height is confounded by generation)
