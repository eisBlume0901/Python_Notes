Similarities between merge and merge_ordered
- Column(s) to join on: on, left_on, right_on
- Type of join: how (left, right, inner, outer)
- Overlapping column names: suffixes

Differences between merge and merge_ordered
merge
- default type of join: inner
- calling the method: df1.merge(df2)
    df1 is left, df2 is right
- similar to the JOIN operation in SQL

merge_ordered
- default type of join: outer
- calling the method: pd.merge(df1, df2)
    df1 is left, df2 is right
- useful when working with ordered data like TIME series data
    performs a merge with an optional filling/interpolation of missing data
