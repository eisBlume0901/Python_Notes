concat()
- concatenate two or more DataFrames along a particular axis (axis=0 and axis=1)
- has additional parameters such as keys, levels, names, verify_integrity, sort, copy
- efficient as it concatenates all at once
append
- concatenate two DataFrames along the axis=0
- does not have additional parameters
- slightly faster than concat (but concatenates two at a time)
