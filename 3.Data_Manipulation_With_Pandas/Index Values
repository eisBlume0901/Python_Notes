Index values are just data (topic 3.slicing_indexing_dataframes.py)

Indexes violate tidy data principles

Tidy Data
1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell

(In short same with how Excel and SQL works especially
for SQL since it has its own cell)
