Histogram
- uses continuous data set (can use discrete - binomial distributions, poisson distributions)
- frequency of the data points within specified ranges (bins_ of values)
- ideal for showing the shape of the distribution, particularly to see if the distribution is normal, skewed, has outliers, etc.
Bar charts
- uses discrete data set
- each bar represents a category, and the height or length of the bar represents a value or count
- ideal for comparing several groups or visualizing the differences between categories
