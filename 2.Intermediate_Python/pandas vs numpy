Pandas - data structure with labeled axes to prevent common errors resulting from misaligned data and working with
differently-indexed data coming from different sources. It is built in NumPy. Simply, pandas are high level Excel since
it has rows and columns and data can be found through row and column.

Best used when:
1. Integrated handling of missing data
2. Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects
3. Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets
4. Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets
5. Intuitive merging and joining data sets

NumPy - used for numerical computation with C-based extension types

Best used when:
1. Performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays and
multidimensional matrices
2. Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation
